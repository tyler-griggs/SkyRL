title: "Development Guide"

## Pre-requisities

Follow the [installation guide](installation). Make sure that the installation works with our [quick start example](quickstart).

## Modifying the code

**Adding a new environment or task?**
Follow the [new task tutorial](../tutorials/new_env). Your custom code can be placed anywhere - building on top of `skyrl_train` as a package - but we recommend structuring it as a folder similar to `examples/multiply`.

**Creating a custom Generator (ex: porting an agent harness, implementing custom trajectory generation logic, etc.)?**
Same as the above: your custom code can be placed anywhere and we typically use `skyrl-train/examples/` for this. See `examples/mini_swe_agent` for an example of creating a custom `Generator` for [Mini-SWE-Agent](https://github.com/SWE-agent/mini-swe-agent).

**Looking to add a new algorithm by changing your advantage estimator or policy loss?**
Follow the guide for [implementing custom algorithms](../algorithms/custom_algorithms). See `examples/algorithms` for examples of various custom algorithm implementations.

**Looking to modify the training loop for full control?**
Follow the guide for [creating a custom trainer](../algorithms/custom_algorithms#creating-a-custom-trainer). See `examples/algorithms/dapo/main_dapo.py` for an example of how to modify the Trainer class for DAPO.

**Modifying the existing environment code (ex: adding a custom method for all Env classes, improving the SearchEnv implementation)?**
You would modify the code in [skyrl-gym](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL/tree/main/skyrl-gym/). Note: you do **not** have to modify the `skyrl-gym` package for adding a new environment or task. 

## Contributing to SkyRL

We welcome all forms of contributions to SkyRL, including bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, code contributions etc. 

## Testing

For code contributions, we recommend running unit tests before submitting a pull request. 

#### SkyRL-train

### CPU tests

```bash
cd skyrl-train # make sure you are in the correct directory
uv run --isolated --extra dev pytest tests/cpu

```

### GPU tests

The GPU tests require a node with atleast 8 GPUs. They have been tested on a 8xH100 node, but should work even on 8xA100 nodes. We are actively working on making these more accessible.

```bash
cd skyrl-train # make sure you are in the correct directory 

```

The tests assume that the GSM8K dataset is downloaded to `~/data/gsm8k`. If you have not downloaded the dataset, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
uv run --isolated examples/gsm8k/gsm8k_dataset.py --output_dir ~/data/gsm8k

```

Finally, you can run the tests by running the following command:

```bash
uv run --isolated --extra dev --extra vllm pytest tests/gpu

```

#### SkyRL-gym

You can run the tests for the `skyrl-gym` package by running the following command:

```bash
cd skyrl-gym # make sure you are in the correct directory
uv run --isolated --extra dev pytest tests/

```

## Linting and Formatting

We use pre-commit hooks to automatically lint and format the code. You can install the pre-commit hooks by running the following command:

```bash
uv pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

```

If you wish to manually run linting and formatting:

```bash
bash format.sh # run from the root directory

```

## Documentation

We welcome contributions to the documentation. The documentation is stored in the `docs/` folder and uses [fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/). 

### Developing locally

We recommend building the documentation locally to preview your changes.

```bash
cd docs
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
